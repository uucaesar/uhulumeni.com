            <p>If you’ve dealt with the National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications (NRCS), you know how long the process can take.</p>
            <p>Standard applications for a Letter of Authority (LOA) often take up to 90 working days — delaying your product launches, imports, and sales.</p>
            <p> <span class="underline">We specialize in expediting NRCS LOA applications to as little as 14 working days,</span> ensuring your products are approved quickly and compliantly.</p>
